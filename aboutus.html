                    <img src="img/prototype.png" alt="prototype design" width="500px"/>
                    <p>For our prototype site we wanted it to have more consistency with bcit.ca's website and we also liked some aspects of the bcitcomp.ca website. We chose the colours schemes of bcit.ca's website and kept some of the layout components of bcitcomp’s website. The header and navigation bar is similar to bcitcomp.ca's website. We wanted the prototype site to be more readable and modern looking with colours and fonts. We also wanted to showcase what HTML5, jQuery can do like we used jQuery to make the lecture list more intuitive for students to navigate and read. Even though our prototype still has a long way to go to achieve what we ultimately want to bring to the student body, but we wholeheartedly believe that our website concept can bring a more consistent, more streamline, and more intuitive studying experience to BCIT’s students in the future, and showcase what us as alumni are capable of.</p>

                            <p>"Hi my name is darrien. I think the website needed to be more effective by making it easy for visitors to find the end goal and help them there. Less clicking and more hovering. My contributions to this project was coding the layout for the prototype and adding the jquery. And we worked together to do the finishing touches."</p>

Our group had a clear goal in the beginning of the project: making the website more visually appealing and easy-reading for students, also keep the colour consistent with the BCIT brand. My contribution to this project is the layout concept design and the meta site building.”</p>

                            <p>"My name is Linda and I worked on this final project of COMP 1950 with Cale and Darrien. We thought that the page needed to be consistent with BCIT’s website. My contributions to the project was half of the prototype pages however we did work as a team to problem solve issues we ran into. An example is when one of the CSS stylesheets weren’t working, one of us would offer to look over the coding and troubleshoot."</p>
